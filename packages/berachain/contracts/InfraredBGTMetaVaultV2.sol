 * @notice  Implementation (for an upgradeable proxy) for a per-user vault that holds the underlying berachain rewards
 *          tokens that can be used to credit a user's Dolomite balance. Tokens held in the vault are considered
 *          to be in isolation mode - that is it cannot be borrowed by other users, may only be seized via
 *          liquidation, and cannot be held in the same position as other "isolated" tokens.
